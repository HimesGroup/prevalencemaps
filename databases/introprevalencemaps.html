<h3>Selected Metropolitan/Micropolitan Area Risk Trends for CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Data Map and Explorer: SMART BRFSS Prevalence Maps</h3>
<p>
This app is for visualizing and exploring prevalence data for multiple conditions as collected by the SMART BRFSS survey for U.S Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas (MMSAs) from the years of 2011 to 2017. 
<br>
<br>
The tab called "Map of MMSA Data" allows you to choose what variable's prevalence you want to look at for specific conditions, years, and MMSAs. The map will visualize the prevalence of chosen conditions on a map of the United States, and will display the prevalence within the chosen MMSA. Gray regions have no data to show, due to missing elements from the source data. The "MMSA-Specific Graphs" will display prevalence of the condition across various demographic variables within that MMSA.

<br>
The US Bivariate Graphs will show inputs for the condition of interest and independent variables of interest over the surveyed years, which you can choose and see the data mapped out both in a proportional bar graph. The US Multivariate Graphs will show inputs for the condition of interest, independent variable of interest, and a stratifying factor, as well as choice of years, which will show the data mapped out in a proportional bar graph. When looking at these graphs, note that ADI quintile is scaled from 0 to 100, with 0 being the least deprived and 100 the most deprived; thus, Q1 is the quintile least deprived, and Q5 is the quintile most deprived.
<br>
<br>
The Regional Graphs split up the US into set Census regions (West, Midwest, Northeast, South, and Puerto Rico) and analyze user-input conditions to show prevalence differences across the five geographical areas, displaying results graphically.
