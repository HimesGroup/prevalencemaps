<h3>Selected Metropolitan/Micropolitan Area Risk Trends for CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Data Map and Explorer: SMART BRFSS Prevalence Maps</h3>
<p>
This app is for visualizing and exploring prevalence data for multiple conditions as collected by the SMART BRFSS survey for U.S Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas (MMSAs). 
<br>
<br>
On the left, the sidebar holds a tab called MMSA-Specific Input, where you can choose what condition's prevalence you want to look at for specific conditions, years, and MMSAs.
<br>
<br>
The Map of MMSA Data will visualize the prevalence of chosen conditions on a map of the United States, and will display the prevalence within the chosen MMSA. The "MMSA-Specific Graphs" will display prevalence of the condition across various demographic variables within that MMSA.
<br>
<br>
The US Bivariate Graphs will show inputs for the condition of interest, independent variable of interest, and years of interest, which you can choose and see the data mapped out both in a proportional bar graph and a logistic regression.
<br>
<br>
The US Multivariate Graphs will show inputs for the condition of interest, independent variable of interest, and a stratifying factor, as well as choice of years, which will show the data mapped out both in a proportional bar graph and a logistic regression.
<br>
<br>
The Regional Graphs split up the US into set Census regions (West, Midwest, Northeast, South, and Puerto Rico) and analyze user-input conditions to show prevalence differences across the five geographical areas.
